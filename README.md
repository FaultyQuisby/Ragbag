# Ragbag
A motley assortment of things. 
Mostly aimed at learning coding stuff.

.txt files are quick notes and tips that are not yet integrated into the wiki.

Be sure to check the wiki if you have any trouble understanding any stuff, 
it should contain only precise and extended explanations.

cheat_sheet.txt is where I put messy stuff that is yet to be sorted and then put on the wiki.

IT IS NORMAL if it's a huge mess and could contain bullshit.
